# Introduction

Mapty is an application that allows users to record and view their workouts on a map. Users can add two different types of workouts, such as running, cycling, and see their workout routes displayed on the map.

The app gets the current location from the browser and passes those cords into a library which renders a map on the position where the user can then initialize workouts by simple click events.

As soon as a workout gets submitted mapty will process the user data makes several ajax calls in the background and show the user the corresponding information for the weather, the location, calculations (pace, speed)

The UI can be manipulated from the user by: Editing workouts, Deleting workouts, Deleting all workouts, Sorting workouts, Navigating the map on the corresponding workouts on the map, Overview of all workouts.
